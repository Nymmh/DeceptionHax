These are just old memories, they don't work anymore.
Was orignialy made for ArmA 2 OA.

This was also my first introduction to coding. Some of the source code if from a friend, I maintained it for a number of years and added a number of functions to it while I still played ArmA 2 OA. What was orignial and what I changed is lost to time or locked away in my brain.
