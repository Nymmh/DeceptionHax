These are just old memories, they don't work anymore.
Was orignialy made for ArmA 2 OA.

This was also my first introduction to coding. Some of the source code is from a friend, I maintained it for a number of years while adding a number of functions to it mainly for Epoch or player stuff while I still played ArmA 2 OA. 

What was orignial and what I changed is lost to time or locked away in my brain.
